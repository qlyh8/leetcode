# Problem 328. Odd Even Linked List

[https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

```
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.


Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
Example 2:


Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

## Solution

`홀`(odd), `짝`(even) 각 노드를 구성한 다음 홀수 노드의 마지막을 짝수 노드의 처음과 이어준다.

```js
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var oddEvenList = function (head) {
  if (!head) {
    return head;
  }
  let odd = head;
  let even = head.next;
  while (odd.next && odd.next.next) {
    let temp = odd.next;
    odd.next = odd.next.next;
    odd = odd.next;
    temp.next = odd.next;
  }
  odd.next = even;
  return head;
};
```
