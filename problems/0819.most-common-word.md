# Problem 819. Most Common Word

[https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/)

```
Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

 
Example 1:

Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
Example 2:

Input: paragraph = "a.", banned = []
Output: "a"
```

## Solution
입력값에 대해 모두 소문자로 바꾸고, 쉼표, 마침표를 제외한 문자열만으로 이루어진 단어 목록을 만든다. `맵`을 이용해 밴되는 단어를 제외한 단어의 개수를 카운트하고 가장 많이 나오는 단어를 출력한다.

```js
/**
 * @param {string} paragraph
 * @param {string[]} banned
 * @return {string}
 */
var mostCommonWord = function(paragraph, banned) {
  const bannedSet = new Set(banned);
  const words = paragraph.toLowerCase().split(/\W+/);
  const map = {};
  let answer = {count: 0, word: ''}
  
  for (const w of words) {
    if (!bannedSet.has(w)) {
      if (map[w] === null) {
          map[w] = 0;
      }
      map[w]++;
        
      if(map[w] > answer.count) {
          answer.count = map[w]
          answer.word = w
      }
    }
  }

  return answer.word;
};

```
