# Problem 771. Jewels and Stones

[https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

```
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

## Solution

특정 문자열에 포함된 문자의 개수를 찾는다. `Set`을 이용해 stones 문자열에 jewels 문자가 있는지 확인하고, 있으면 카운팅한다.  

```js
/**
 * @param {string} jewels
 * @param {string} stones
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function (jewels, stones) {
  const set = new Set(jewels);
  return [...stones].reduce((res, s) => res + set.has(s), 0);
};
```
